Public data regarding airline passegners is very limited online. There is some public data related to the whole industry. For example, [Commercial Aviation Departures](https://data.bts.gov/Aviation/Commercial-Aviation-Departures/bpqk-hyst) from the **U.S Department of Transportation (DOT)** available at **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**.

This graphic confirms the collected info in different articles lu7ike this one: [Why do airlines overbook their flights?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/overbooking/) from **TechCrunch** that states, Tuesdays is one of the most predictable days for people to miss a flight. It's something that will be explained more at the final presentation.
