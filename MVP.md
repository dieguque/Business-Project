Any passengers per airline public data is very limited, but there is some public data realated to the whole industry like the [Commercial Aviation Departures](https://data.bts.gov/Aviation/Commercial-Aviation-Departures/bpqk-hyst) from the **U.S Department of Transportation (DOT)** available at **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**.
To start to see we used the **57 St - 7 Av** station data from January 2019 to May 2021. On the graphic above we can crearly see a descrease on the users around March-April 2020. Just when COVID-19 began and crearly there is not much recovery afther that.

This graphic conmfirs the clloected info in different articles like this one: [Why do airlines overbook their flights?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/overbooking/) from **TechCrunch** that states by different factors, Tuesdays is one of the most predictable days for people to miss a fligh. It's something that will be explained more at the final presentation.
