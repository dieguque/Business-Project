# Making overbooking flights predictable üõ©Ô∏è

## How can over-booking can be improved on an airlines?

An airlines in the USA is interested in knowing more about overbooking. Overbooking is a common and necessary practice on airlines, specially in low cost airlines. This industry run a very low profits, so overbooking is essential to keep a low prices and make the business more profitable. The airline will benefit in understanding more about overbooking and consequently increase their profit.

### Question/Need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
  The main question is how to predict the overbooking flights on a specific airline (try to avoid the whole industry data). To make it possible I will create a predictive model.
  
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
  The decision makers will benefit from having a model that will let them know how to overbook flights.
  
### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
  The Department of Tranportation has public data on [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov)

* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
  The goal is to be able to get the data per airline, then choose an airline to do the project based on that airline.

* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
  My target should be the number of booking on the airline
  
### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
  I plan to use Excel and Google Sheets to do the EDA and Jupyter Notebook to do the modeling.

* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
  Not for now.
  
### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
  Be able to some airlines industry data and EDA will be mi MVP
